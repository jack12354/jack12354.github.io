			<p>Welcome to my web site</p>
			<h2>Something about myself</h2>
		<p>I'm a backend developer, but I'm happiest with my hands in a debugger, developing new systems to process data, or designing satisfying interactions. Born in Maine, and developing in Boston and New York since 2015, I've worked in several industries from games to maritime logistics to home security, picking up new techniques the whole time.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Here's a few links to some of my better projects. Preemptive apologies for terrible control schemes and rampant use of programmer art.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/jack12354/TanKompilers">TanKompilers</a> - a tanks game with instructions that get compiled and run on the fly</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/jack12354/TD">TD</a> - basis for a tower defense game</li>
				<li>Milk</li>
			</ul>
