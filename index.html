			<p>Welcome to my web site</p>
			<h2>Something about myself</h2>
			<p>I'm an all-over developer, but I'm happiest with my hands in a debugger, developing new systems to process data, or designing satisfying interactions. Born in Maine, and developing in Boston since 2015, I've worked in several industries from games to maritime logistics, picking up new techniques the whole time.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Here's a few links to some of my better projects. Preemptive apologies for terrible control schemes and rampant use of programmer art.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/jack12354/TanKompilers">TanKompilers</a> - a tanks game with instructions that get compiled and run on the fly</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/jack12354/TD">TD</a> - basis for a tower defense game</li>
				<li>Milk</li>
			</ul>

			<p>For some reason I find myself sure that handcrafted HTML is the way of the future. It's not tedious, it's <i>artisanal.</i></p>
