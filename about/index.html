			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Jack Baker. I live in London with <a href="http://www.jasminejbaker.co">my wife</a>, our plants, our cat, and too many ideas. I spent the first decade of my adult life in and around Boston, MA. My first language was trying to reverse engineer the BASIC programs that made up my math homework back in 7th grade, which I promptly forgot about until four years later, when I learned Java and enough TI-BASIC to not have to memorize my calculus theorems. I then moved on to learn C# and C++ and found  my happy place (It's C# 6.0 for those counting at home.) I dabbled in a few other languages, but kept finding my way back to C# and C++. Lately, I've really been enjoying using Go to build out new services.</p>
			<p>If, for some reason, you'd like to give me a job, you can get a copy of my resume at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e1HUOzGHCfKwofewKLAOT5EIfMmW645jhQEUyxI2vrk/export?format=pdf">this fancy link</a> which will roll out a fresh PDF for you, hot off the presses.
